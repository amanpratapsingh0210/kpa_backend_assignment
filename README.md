# Backend API Development Assignment - KPA ERP
This repository contains the source code for a backend application developed as part of the KPA ERP assignment. The application is built using Python with the FastAPI framework and connects to a PostgreSQL database.

Implemented APIs
I have implemented the following two API endpoints as per the assignment requirements:

POST /api/v1/form-data/

Description: This endpoint allows for the creation of a new user form data entry. It accepts a JSON body with user details, validates the input, and stores it in the PostgreSQL database. It prevents duplicate entries based on phone_number and email.

Request Body:

{
  "full_name": "string",
  "phone_number": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "date_of_birth": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "gender": "string",
  "city": "string",
  "state": "string"
}

Success Response (201 Created):

{
  "full_name": "string",
  "phone_number": "string",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "date_of_birth": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "gender": "string",
  "city": "string",
  "state": "string",
  "id": 1,
  "is_active": true
}

GET /api/v1/form-data/

Description: This endpoint retrieves a list of all form data entries currently stored in the database. It supports basic pagination via skip and limit query parameters.

Success Response (200 OK):

[
  {
    "full_name": "string",
    "phone_number": "string",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "date_of_birth": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "gender": "string",
    "city": "string",
    "state": "string",
    "id": 1,
    "is_active": true
  }
]

Set up the database:

Ensure you have PostgreSQL running.

Create a database named kpa_db.

Create a .env file in the root directory by copying the .env.example (or creating it from scratch).

Update the DATABASE_URL in the .env file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost/kpa_db

Run the application:

uvicorn main:app --reload
